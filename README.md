Context:
There are several ways for students and teachers to interact during the course of the study. One of the ways is using a Conversations feature available on the Learning Management System.
This enables 1x1 digital conversation between a student and his/her respective teacher, whereby the student can leave a query in the form of a message for a teacher who can respond at their convenience.

Goal:
In order to improve student experience, it is important to understand the current pattern of how responsive teachers are to the messages left by their students on this platform.

Dataset Column Description:

Student.ID Unique Identifier of the student who has sent a message to teacher
Teacher.ID Unique Identifier of the teacher who responds to the message by student
College.Name College to which the teacher belongs
School.Name School to which the teacher belongs
Student.Message.Time Date time stamp at which the student sent a message
Teacher.Response.Time Date time stamp at which the teacher responded to the message

Timeliness of Response  = Teacher Response Time - Student Message Time

Q1: How responsive are the teachers at the college level?

Q2: Do you think that the responsiveness on a weekly basis of "College of Business" has improved from Span 1 to Span 2? Is this improvement statistically significant assuming independence between the data points?
Span 1. => 4 March 2019 to 23 June 2019 (12 Weeks)
Span 2. => 22 July 2019 to 13 October 2019 (12 Weeks)
Week Starting should be considered to be Monday
Please share your code/script (as applicable) along with the answer to the question listed above

Q3: Which schools, do you think, need to improve on their timeliness of response to the students?
Support your answer using visualisation(s)

Q4: Can you think of any examples of poor responsiveness and share any strategies which could improve the timeliness of response?
